   - Ensure all checkboxes are checked
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - **Expected**: 
     - Status changes to "Recording" (red dot)
     - Timer starts (00:00, 00:01, etc.)
     - Success message appears

4. **Perform Test Interactions**:
   - Click various elements on the page
   - Type in any input fields
   - Submit any forms (if available)
   - **Expected**: 
     - Action count increases in popup
     - No error messages in console

   - Click "Stop" in popup
   - **Expected**:
     - Status returns to "Ready"
     - Success message appears
     - Session appears in "Recent Sessions"

### Step 3: Advanced Feature Testing

#### Test 1: Screenshot Capture System
1. Start recording with "Capture screenshots" enabled
2. Perform 5-10 quick clicks in succession
3. Stop recording
4. Export as "Screenshots" 
5. **Expected**: Multiple PNG files download without quota errors

#### Test 2: Event Capture Verification
1. Start recording
2. Open browser console
3. Load the diagnostic script:
   ```javascript
   // Paste contents of test_event_capture.js
   ```
4. **Expected**: All diagnostic tests should pass
5. Use `testRealClick()` function to verify real-time capture

#### Test 3: Request Filtering
1. Navigate to a complex website (like GitHub or Stack Overflow)
2. Start recording with "Filter JS/CSS/assets" **checked**
3. Interact with the page
4. Stop and export JSON
5. **Expected**: Network requests should focus on API calls, not static assets

6. Repeat with filtering **unchecked**
7. **Expected**: Many more requests including .js, .css, images

#### Test 4: Markdown Export
1. Complete a recording session with several interactions
2. Click "Export MD" 
3. **Expected**: 
   - Markdown file downloads
   - No error messages
   - File contains readable session summary

### Step 4: Fiori Application Testing

#### If you have access to a Fiori/SAPUI5 application:

1. **Navigate to Fiori Launchpad or Fiori App**

2. **Test SAPUI5 Detection**:
   - Open popup
   - **Expected**: Should show "‚úÖ SAPUI5 Application Detected"
   - App details should show version and theme info

3. **Test Complete Workflow**:
   - Start recording
   - Navigate between tiles/apps
   - Perform business operations (search, filter, edit)
   - Generate some OData traffic
   - Stop recording

4. **Verify Rich Data Capture**:
   - Export markdown
   - **Expected**: Should contain:
     - OData analysis section
     - UI5 context information
     - Semantic event descriptions
     - Network request correlation

### Step 5: Error Handling Testing

#### Test Error Recovery:

1. **Tab Closing During Recording**:
   - Start recording
   - Close the tab
   - Open extension in new tab
   - **Expected**: No hanging sessions, clean state

2. **Background Script Communication**:
   - Start recording
   - In console, run: `chrome.runtime.reload()`
   - Continue interactions
   - **Expected**: Content script should handle communication failures gracefully

3. **Large Session Testing**:
   - Start recording
   - Perform 50+ interactions rapidly
   - Include multiple file uploads if possible
   - **Expected**: No memory issues, smooth performance

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Events array is empty" despite interactions

**Diagnosis**:
1. Run the diagnostic script: `/home/alice/dev/fiori_automator/test_event_capture.js`
2. Check console for content script messages
3. Verify recording state synchronization

**Solutions**:
- Reload the page and restart recording
- Check if content script is properly injected
- Try manual event test from diagnostic script

### Issue: "Screenshot quota exceeded"

**Diagnosis**: Look for `MAX_CAPTURE_VISIBLE_TAB_CALLS_PER_SECOND` errors

**Solutions**:
- This should now be fixed with rate limiting
- If still occurring, reduce screenshot frequency in settings

### Issue: "Markdown export fails"

**Diagnosis**: Check console for specific error messages

**Solutions**:
- Ensure session has some data before exporting
- Check if background script is responding to export requests

### Issue: "SAPUI5 not detected"

**Diagnosis**: 
1. Check if page actually uses SAPUI5
2. Look for UI5 resources in network tab
3. Run UI5 detection manually in console

**Solutions**:
- Wait for page to fully load before opening popup
- Some UI5 apps may not be detectable (this is normal)

## üìä Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ All Tests Pass When:

1. **Installation**: Extension loads without service worker errors
2. **Basic Recording**: Can start/stop recording, see events captured
3. **Screenshots**: Multiple screenshots captured without quota errors  
4. **Events**: Diagnostic script shows all tests passing
5. **Filtering**: Clear difference between filtered and unfiltered requests
6. **Export**: All export formats (JSON, Markdown, Screenshots) work

8. **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from common failure scenarios

### üéØ Expected Performance:

- **Session Start**: < 2 seconds
- **Event Capture**: < 100ms per event
- **Screenshot Capture**: < 1 second (with rate limiting)
- **Export Generation**: < 5 seconds for typical session
- **Memory Usage**: No significant leaks during extended sessions

## üìû If Issues Persist

1. **Collect Debug Information**:
   - Run diagnostic script and save output
   - Export chrome extension logs
   - Note specific error messages

2. **Check Extension Console**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click "background page" or "service worker"
   - Look for error messages

3. **Browser Console**:
   - Check both page console and extension popup console
   - Look for network request failures

Remember: The extension should now work reliably with all critical issues fixed!
