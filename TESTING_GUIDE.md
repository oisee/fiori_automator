3. **Perform Test Interactions**:
   - Click various elements (buttons, links, etc.)
   - Type in input fields
   - Submit forms if available
   - **Expected Results**:
     - Action count increases in popup
     - No console errors

     - Status returns to "Ready"
     - Success message appears
     - Session appears in "Recent Sessions" list

### Step 3: Export Testing

#### Test 1: JSON Export
1. Click "Export JSON" button
2. **Expected**: 
   - File downloads: `fs-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-test-recording.json`
   - Contains session data with events array populated
   - Screenshots referenced with semantic IDs
   - Summary section with sequence data

#### Test 2: Markdown Export  
1. Click "Export MD" button
2. **Expected**:
   - File downloads: `fs-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-test-recording.md`
   - Contains mermaid diagrams (business process flow)
   - Screenshots embedded as `![Event Screenshot](filename.png)`
   - OData operations summary (if any detected)
   - Clean event timeline (noise filtered out)

#### Test 3: Screenshot Export
1. Click "Screenshots" button  
2. **Expected**:
   - Multiple PNG files download individually
   - Filenames: `fs-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-test-recording-EEEE-type.png`
   - Files sort together naturally
   - JSON file also downloads with session data

### Step 4: Advanced Feature Testing

#### Screenshot Rate Limiting Test
1. Start recording
2. Perform 10+ rapid clicks (as fast as possible)
3. **Expected**: 
   - No "quota exceeded" errors in console
   - Screenshots captured with proper spacing
   - Extension remains responsive

#### Request Filtering Test
1. Navigate to complex website (GitHub, Stack Overflow)
2. Start recording with filtering **enabled**
3. Interact with page, stop recording, export JSON
4. **Expected**: Network requests focus on API calls, not .js/.css files

5. Repeat with filtering **disabled**
6. **Expected**: Many more requests including static assets

#### SAPUI5 Detection Test (if Fiori available)
1. Navigate to Fiori application
2. Open popup before recording
3. **Expected**: 
   - "‚úÖ SAPUI5 Application Detected" message
   - App details show version, theme info
   - Session name auto-improves to app name

### Step 5: Error Recovery Testing

#### Communication Failure Test
1. Start recording
2. Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Sources ‚Üí Pause script execution
3. Perform interactions
4. Resume script execution
5. **Expected**: Extension recovers gracefully, events stored locally

#### Tab Closure Test  
1. Start recording
2. Close tab during recording
3. Open new tab, check extension
4. **Expected**: No hanging sessions, clean state

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Events Captured
**Diagnosis**: Run diagnostic script in browser console:
```javascript
// Paste content of /test_event_capture.js and run
```
**Common Causes**: 
- Content script not injected (fixed in current version)
- Recording state not synchronized (fixed in current version)

### Issue: Export Fails
**Check**: Browser console for specific error messages
**Common Causes**:
- Session has no data (record some interactions first)
- Type errors in request processing (fixed in current version)

### Issue: Screenshots Missing
**Check**: Console for quota errors or rate limiting messages
**Cause**: Chrome API limits (fixed with queue system)

### Issue: Filename Format Wrong
**Expected Format**: `fs-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-session-name-EEEE-type.ext`
**Check**: Files should sort together and use semantic naming

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
- **Session Start**: < 2 seconds
- **Event Capture**: < 100ms per event  
- **Screenshot Capture**: < 1 second (with rate limiting)
- **Export Generation**: < 5 seconds for typical session
- **Memory Usage**: Stable during extended sessions

### Stress Testing
- **Large Sessions**: 200+ events should work smoothly
- **Rapid Interactions**: 5+ clicks/second should be handled gracefully
- **Long Sessions**: 30+ minutes should not cause memory leaks
- **Multiple Tabs**: Extension should work independently per tab
