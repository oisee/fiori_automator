# Fiori Test Automation System - Browser Extension

üéØ **The First Step to Killing Fiori: Capture Everything, Then Eliminate the UI**

## üöÄ The Vision: From 23 Clicks to Zero

This extension is the first phase in eliminating the Fiori UI layer entirely. By capturing every interaction, UI5 context, and OData request, we're building the foundation for direct AI-to-OData communication. 

**Current Reality**: User ‚Üí Clicks ‚Üí UI ‚Üí OData ‚Üí Backend  
**Our Future**: User ‚Üí Natural Language ‚Üí OData ‚Üí Backend

The extension proves that 80% of Fiori interactions are pure UI overhead. Once we capture the patterns, we can bypass the UI entirely.

## ‚úÖ Current Status: Fully Functional

This extension is **production-ready** with all major issues resolved:
- ‚úÖ Service worker installation and manifest compliance
- ‚úÖ Event capture with proper synchronization  
- ‚úÖ Screenshot system with semantic filenames and rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Bundle export (JSON + Markdown + Screenshots in ZIP)
- ‚úÖ Clean semantic filename format across all exports
- ‚úÖ Enhanced SAPUI5/Fiori app detection
- ‚úÖ Request filtering for business-focused captures
- ‚úÖ Audio recording with voice narration support
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for filename generation

## üéØ Why This Extension Exists

After analyzing hundreds of Fiori sessions, we discovered:
- **80% waste**: Most interactions are just translating clicks to OData calls
- **10 clicks, 27 seconds** for simple updates that should take 1 second
- **23 @UI annotations** just to display fields that already exist in the backend

This extension captures the patterns needed to build the ultimate solution: an MCP-OData bridge that lets AI talk directly to SAP backends, eliminating the UI entirely.

### The Master Plan
1. **Phase 1** (This Extension): Capture all interactions, understand the patterns
2. **Phase 2** (Coming Soon): Build parametrized automations from captured sessions  
3. **Phase 3** (The Kill Shot): MCP-OData Bridge - Natural language directly to backend

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder
5. Pin the extension to your toolbar

### Basic Usage
1. **Navigate** to any SAP Fiori application
2. **Click** the extension icon and select "Start Recording"
3. **Interact** with the Fiori app (clicks, forms, navigation)
4. **Stop** recording when finished
5. **Export** your session as JSON or Bundle (recommended)

### What to Capture (For Maximum Impact)
Focus on capturing sessions that show:
- **Repetitive tasks** you do daily (these are prime automation candidates)
- **Multi-step processes** that should be simple (expose the UI complexity)
- **Data updates** that require navigating through multiple screens
- **Search and filter operations** that could be natural language queries
- **Any workflow where you think** "there must be a better way"

Each captured session helps map the OData services behind the UI curtain.

## üìã Features

### Core Capabilities (Building Blocks for UI Elimination)
- **Universal Capture**: Records all user interactions to understand how humans navigate the UI maze
- **OData Correlation**: The key insight - every UI action eventually triggers OData calls (this is what we'll use directly)
- **SAPUI5 Context**: Extracts the business logic hidden behind @UI annotations and control hierarchies
- **Screenshot Capture**: Documents the visual overhead we're about to eliminate
- **Real-time Analysis**: Shows exactly how much time is wasted on UI navigation
- **Session Management**: Build a library of patterns for direct OData access

### Advanced Features
- **Network Request Interception**: Captures all HTTP requests with intelligent filtering
- **Business Process Flow**: Clean mermaid diagrams showing meaningful operations only
- **Visual Documentation**: Screenshots automatically embedded in markdown exports
- **Request Filtering**: Smart filtering of JS/CSS/assets to focus on business operations
- **Semantic Filenames**: Clean, sortable filenames for all exports
- **Audio Recording**: Optional voice narration during sessions
- **Bundle Export**: Single ZIP containing JSON, Markdown, and all screenshots
- **Enhanced App Detection**: Uses UI5 models, About Dialog, and Fiori Apps Library integration

### Export Options

#### 1. **Save JSON** - Session Data Only
- File: `fs-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-app-name.json`
- Complete session data with metadata
- Application intelligence summary
- Screenshot references
- OData correlation analysis

#### 2. **Save Bundle** - Complete Package (Recommended)
- File: `fs-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-app-name.zip`
- Contains: JSON + Markdown + All Screenshots
- Ready for sharing and documentation
- All files use consistent naming scheme

#### 3. **Export Audio** (if recorded)
- File: `fs-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-app-name-audio.webm`
- Voice narration recorded during session
- Normal quality, opus codec

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Manifest V3** Chrome extension with proper service worker
- **Content Script**: Captures DOM events and UI5 context
- **Background Script**: Manages sessions, screenshots, and exports
- **Injected Scripts**: Deep access to page context and UI5 internals

### Filename Format
All exports use a consistent semantic naming pattern:
```
fs-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-app-name.{extension}
```

Examples:
- `fs-2025-06-10-1430-manage-detection-methods.json`
- `fs-2025-06-10-1430-manage-detection-methods.zip`
- `fs-2025-06-10-1430-manage-detection-methods-0001-click.png`

### Screenshot System
- **Rate Limited**: Maximum 2 screenshots per second
- **Semantic IDs**: Sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)
- **Event Correlation**: Each screenshot linked to specific user action
- **Quality**: Full viewport capture with element highlighting

### SAPUI5 Detection Methods
1. **UI5 Model Data** (AppInfo, SysInfo JSONModels)
2. **About Dialog** pattern detection
3. **Direct API** access to `sap.ui.getCore()`
4. **DOM Heuristics** for Fiori patterns
5. **URL Analysis** for app component patterns
6. **Fiori Apps Library** correlation

## üß™ Testing & Debugging

### Installation Verification
1. Check extension loads without errors in `chrome://extensions/`
2. Verify all files present: `manifest.json`, `background.js`, `content.js`, etc.
3. Test popup interface opens correctly

### Recording Test
1. Navigate to any Fiori application
2. Open browser DevTools Console
3. Start recording and look for debug messages:
   ```
   [Fiori] Recording started - isRecording = true
   [Fiori] Click captured and sent to background
   ```

### Export Test  
1. Record a short session (2-3 clicks)
2. Stop recording
3. Open Sessions page and test "Save Bundle"
4. Verify ZIP contains JSON + MD + PNG files

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging:
1. Open browser console
2. Run: `localStorage.setItem('fiori-debug', 'true')`
3. Reload page - you'll see detailed logging

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension won't install**
- Check Chrome version (requires Manifest V3 support)
- Ensure all files present in directory
- Check for syntax errors in manifest.json

**No events captured**
- Verify content script loaded (check console)
- Check if page has CSP restrictions
- Enable debug mode for detailed logging

**Screenshots not working**
- Check chrome.tabs permission in manifest
- Verify tab is active and visible
- Check rate limiting (max 2/second)

**Bundle export empty**
- Check if session has events
- Verify screenshots were captured during recording
- Enable debug logging to see screenshot collection

### Support
For issues or questions:
1. Enable debug mode and check console logs
2. Check the Sessions page for detailed session data
3. Verify all extension files are present and loaded

## üîÆ The Endgame: Life After Fiori

When this project succeeds, here's what changes:

### Before (Fiori Way)
```
User: "Update purchase order 4500123456 delivery date to next Friday"
Steps: Open Fiori ‚Üí Find App ‚Üí Click Tile ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Search PO ‚Üí Click Edit ‚Üí 
       Change Date ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Close
Time: 4 minutes, 23 clicks
```

### After (Direct OData)
```
User: "Update purchase order 4500123456 delivery date to next Friday"
AI: Done. Delivery date updated to July 3, 2025.
Time: 2 seconds, 0 clicks
```

The extension you're using today is capturing the data to make this future possible. Every session recorded brings us closer to eliminating the 80% waste in enterprise software.
