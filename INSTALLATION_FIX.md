## What Was Fixed

### Background Script (background.js)
- **Fixed duplicate variable declaration**: Changed `const tabId` to `const eventTabId` in the capture-event case
- **Enhanced logging**: Added comprehensive debugging throughout event processing
- **Error handling**: Better error tracking and reporting

### Missing Scripts Created
- **injected.js**: Page context script for deep UI5 access
- **ui5-detector.js**: Enhanced SAPUI5 detection with multiple detection methods

### Enhanced Features
- **Comprehensive debugging**: Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Better UI5 detection**: Multiple detection strategies for improved reliability
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks when detection fails

## Testing the Fix

After installation, test the extension:

1. **Navigate to a Fiori application**
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Look for these messages**:
   ```
   [Fiori] Initializing content script...
   [UI5 Detector] Starting enhanced UI5 detection
   [Fiori Injected] Script loaded in page context
   ```

4. **Open extension popup** and start recording
5. **Verify**: No error messages in console, extension responds normally

## Debugging Tools Available

If you still experience issues:

1. **Run diagnostic script**: Copy contents of `DIAGNOSTIC_SCRIPT.js` into browser console
2. **Check debugging guide**: See `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting steps
3. **Review logs**: Look for `[Fiori]` prefixed messages in console

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Extension loads without service worker errors
- ✅ No JavaScript syntax errors in console
- ✅ Enhanced UI5 detection with higher accuracy
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ Better error handling and recovery

The extension should now install and run properly without the previous errors!
